# üß† Dynamic Programming Problems

This repository serves as a personal reference and learning resource for mastering DP techniques such as memoization, tabulation, and space optimization.

## üìÅ File Structure

Dynamic programming is a fundamental concept in algorithm design that is beneficial for solving problems with overlapping subproblems and optimizing substructures. This repository contains:

- Recursive approach
- Top-down (Recursive + Memoization) approach
- Bottom-up (Tabulation) approach
- Optimized versions with reduced space complexity
- Clear comments and code organization for better understanding

## üß© Topics Covered

- Fibonacci series
- Minimum cost of climbing stairs
